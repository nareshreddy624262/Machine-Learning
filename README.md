# SAT to CGPA Prediction using Single Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of single linear regression using machine learning to predict a student's CGPA based on their SAT score. Linear regression is one of the most basic machine learning algorithms used to establish a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes SAT scores as the independent variable (X) and CGPA as the dependent variable (Y). The data consists of several student records with their respective SAT scores and CGPA.

### Features
- **SAT Score**: The SAT score of the student.
- **CGPA**: The cumulative grade point average, which is predicted by the model.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure
```
|-- dataset.csv          # CSV file containing SAT scores and CGPA
|-- linear_regression.py  # Main Python script for the linear regression model
|-- README.md            # Project documentation (this file)
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is split into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: A simple linear regression model is trained using the training data.
4. **Prediction**: The model predicts CGPA values for the test data.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Running the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sat-cgpa-linear-regression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sat-cgpa-linear-regression
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression.py
   ```

## Example Output
The model will output the predicted CGPA for a given SAT score along with performance metrics like the R-squared value.

## Visualization
If you wish to visualize the results, the script includes code to plot a graph of the SAT score vs CGPA along with the regression line.
